# Handoff — 2026-02-26

**From:** Architect  
**To:** Dev  
**Status:** D-034 live. Ready for MCP connector + Phase 3 pre-work.

## 1. Endpoint Details

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **URL** | https://graph1-production.up.railway.app |
| **Health** | https://graph1-production.up.railway.app/health (no auth) |
| **MCP** | https://graph1-production.up.railway.app/mcp (Bearer auth) |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>` — same value as Railway Variables |

**Tools:** get_policy, get_threshold, list_policies, list_thresholds, get_federation_sources, get_subject_concepts, run_cypher_readonly

---

## 2. Claude.ai MCP Connector Setup

1. Claude.ai → Settings → Integrations → Add MCP Server
2. Enter endpoint URL: `https://graph1-production.up.railway.app`
3. Add header: `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>` (use the value from Railway Variables)
4. Save and connect

## 3. Commit Manifest

**Suggested commit message:**

```
Handoff 2026-02-26: D-034 live, sequence for Phase 3

[Transcript journal entry: D-034 MCP Phase 2 deployed to Railway. Endpoint live at graph1-production.up.railway.app. Architect handoff note added. Sequence: connect MCP → D-033 verification → Phase 3 pre-work queries → refine spec → D-035 (D12/D13 + entity_count).]
```

**Files to commit:** HANDOFF_2026-02-26.md

## 4. D-035 Scope (Next Implementation)

**D12/D13 wire read paths** — SCA reads crosslink and drift thresholds from graph instead of hardcoded values.

**entity_count cleanup** — SubjectConcept nodes: populate entity_count (and facets) before SFA work. Currently null.

**Reference:** KANBAN backlog; sysml/DMN_DECISION_TABLES.md D12, D13.

## 5. Prototype Definition of Done

- [ ] Claude.ai MCP connector connected to Railway endpoint
- [ ] D-033 verification queries run via run_cypher_readonly
- [ ] Phase 3 pre-work queries run (output/PHASE3_PREWORK_QUERIES.md when created)
- [ ] Library Authority Integration spec refined from live graph state
- [ ] D-035 implementation started (D12/D13 + entity_count)

---

## 6. Open Questions

- SYS_FederationSource pid/scoping_weight/property_name — stub nodes. Populate before federation subsystem goes live? (DECISIONS.md D-034 gap)
- Phase 3 pre-work query set — architect to produce after MCP connected

## 7. Sequence from Here

```
1. Dev commits HANDOFF_2026-02-26.md → clean-master
2. Architect connects Claude.ai MCP connector to Railway endpoint
3. Architect runs D-033 verification via run_cypher_readonly
4. Architect runs Phase 3 pre-work queries (output/PHASE3_PREWORK_QUERIES.md)
5. Architect refines Phase 3 spec from live graph state
6. D-035 implementation (D12/D13 + entity_count cleanup)
```
