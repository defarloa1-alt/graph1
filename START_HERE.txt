CHRYSTALLUM — START HERE
========================
Last updated: 2026-02-25

New agent or developer entering a session? Read in this order:

1. Kanban Board           — Ctrl+Shift+P → "Open Kanban Board" (LachyFS). Tasks in .devtool/features/. Context: .devtool/KANBAN_CONTEXT.md
2. DECISIONS.md           — Why decisions were made. Read recent entries first.
3. REQUIREMENTS.md        — What the system must do.
4. Key Files/ARCHITECTURE_CORE.md  — What the system is.

That is enough context for most sessions.

CURRENT STATUS (2026-02-26)
----------------------------
- DPRR federation: complete (all three passes done)
- Graph baseline: 60,925 nodes / 49,152 edges
- Global unscoped: ~8.8% (wars/battles are legitimate-unscoped, see DECISIONS D-011)
- Cluster assignment: complete
- Cleanup: complete (3,083 nodes removed)
- **Current focus:** Phase 3 A1 Federation Positioning — ground SubjectConcepts in federated schema (Dewey/LCC/LCSH/FAST)

---

TWO ACTIVE PATHS
-----------------
Path 1 — Operational: federation imports, cluster assignment, scoping
Path 2 — Self-describing subgraph: FederationRegistry → SchemaRegistry → Bibliography → Process

Path 2 does not block Path 1.

DEPRECATED
-----------
AI_CONTEXT.md — moved to Archive/. Replaced by DECISIONS.md + Kanban extension (.devtool/features/) + architecture docs.
START_HERE.txt (previous version) — described legacy agent training pipeline, no longer current.

---

WORKING MODEL
--------------
Architect (Claude) + Dev working in parallel.
You relay between us via this chat.
Architect: design decisions, sequencing, QA review of dev output.
Dev: execution — scripts, imports, Neo4j operations.
Path 2 tasks handed to dev as discrete specs with no open design decisions.
