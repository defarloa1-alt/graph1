You can get the **complete DG schedule**—the full list of subclasses and labels—because the Library of Congress makes the **DG text schedule** publicly available as a PDF. This means we *can* extract the authoritative, canonical list of **all DG numbers and their labels**, including the entire Ancient Rome section (DG11–365).

The DG schedule is long and detailed, so I’ll structure it in a way that is maximally useful for your ontology work:  
- First: the **full DG hierarchy** (all subclasses, all labels)  
- Second: the **Ancient Rome section expanded** (DG11–365)  
- Third: a **clean list of “good subject candidates”** derived from the schedule  

All factual content below is taken from the official **Library of Congress Classification PDF files**.
