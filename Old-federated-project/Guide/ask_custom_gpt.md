## Quick Prompts for Development

### For New Features:
```
I need to implement [specific feature]. Based on the federated graph framework patterns, show me:
1. Which files to modify
2. The correct pattern to follow
3. Any mathematical constraints to respect
```

### For Debugging:
```
I'm getting this error: [paste error]
Context: Running [specific command]
Help me debug this considering the experimental design philosophy.
```

### For Architecture Questions:
```
Explain how [specific component] works as a first-class mathematical object in the framework.
```

### For Code Review:
```
Review this code for compliance with the federated graph framework patterns:
[paste code]
```

## Integration Workflow

1. **Before coding**: Ask Custom GPT about patterns and constraints
2. **During development**: Use for debugging and pattern validation  
3. **After coding**: Request code review against framework principles
4. **For learning**: Ask about mathematical concepts and their implementation
