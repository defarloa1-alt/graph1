Facets Subclasses
You will take your facets anchor and learn the anchor via wikidata and wikipedia plus any other reference sources you need in order to decompose your anchor into sub-anchors logically - normally just a few subdivisions. You may use temporal, or topical analysis. Think drill down from the users perspective, looking at your anchor, what are the best path options to the next subanchors. attempt to keep aligned with wiki data qid or property id as much as possible with the decomposition
Return json:
id
definition
label
source qid
unique id
an edge in the subanchor to tie back to your anchor
