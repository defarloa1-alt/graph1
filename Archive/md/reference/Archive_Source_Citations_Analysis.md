## Source Verification

### 1. Steven Johnson - "Wonderland"

**Book**: "Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World" (2016)

**Relevance**: 
- Johnson's book explores how leisure and play have driven innovation
- Likely contains sections on textiles, dyes, and trade
- May discuss cotton trade and Indian textile innovations

**What to Check**:
- Does Johnson discuss India's cotton dominance?
- Does he cover the mordant process and dyeing techniques?
- Does he mention the Ajanta Caves in relation to cotton processing?
- Does he discuss the economic impact of Indian textiles?

**Note**: Need to verify if Johnson's book actually supports all the claims made in the text, especially:
- GDP dominance claim
- Trade surplus claim
- Ajanta Caves date (if mentioned)

---

### 2. Strabo - "Geography"

**Source**: Strabo's "Geography" (ancient Greek geographer, c. 64 BCE - c. 24 CE)

**Relevance**:
- Strabo's Geography contains sections on India
- May describe Indian products, trade, and resources
- Could mention cotton or textiles

**What to Check**:
- Which book/chapter of Strabo's Geography discusses India?
- Does Strabo mention cotton, textiles, or trade?
- How does Strabo's account compare to Herodotus (also mentioned)?
- Does Strabo's description align with the text's claims?

**Note**: Strabo lived in the 1st century BCE/CE, so he could describe India's economic situation during that period. However, he would NOT be a source for:
- 2300 BCE claims (too early)
- Claims about 1 CE - 1500 CE period (he died before most of it)

---

### 3. John Keay - "India: A History"

**Book**: "India: A History" (2000, revised 2010)

**Relevance**:
- Comprehensive history of India
- Likely covers economic history, trade, and textiles
- Authoritative source for Indian history

**What to Check**:
- Does Keay discuss India's GDP dominance in the specified period?
- Does he mention the 1000-year trade surplus?
- Does he cover cotton trade and textile innovations?
- Does he discuss archaeological evidence (2300 BCE cotton)?
- Does he address Islamic imperial ambitions and India's wealth?

**Note**: Keay is a respected historian, but we should verify:
- If his book actually makes these specific claims
- If the text accurately represents Keay's arguments
- If there are nuanced interpretations the text may have missed

## Critical Validation Points

### Issue #1: Ajanta Caves Date Error

**Question**: Do any of these sources support the 2300 BCE date for Ajanta Caves?

**Expected Answer**: 
- ❌ **No** - Ajanta Caves are from 2nd century BCE - 5th century CE
- The text may have confused:
  - Indus Valley cotton discovery (2300 BCE) ✓ Correct
  - Ajanta Caves (200 BCE - 500 CE) ✓ Correct
  - But incorrectly linked them together ❌ Error

**Need to Check**: Does the text misread a source, or is this an independent error?

---

### Issue #2: Islamic Imperial Ambitions Logic

**Question**: Do these sources support the claim that wealth "deterred" Islamic ambitions?

**Expected Answer**:
- Need to check if Johnson or Keay make this claim
- Historical evidence suggests the opposite (wealth attracted conquest)
- May be a misinterpretation of a source

**Need to Check**: 
- What does Keay actually say about Islamic expansion and India's wealth?
- Does Johnson discuss this dynamic?
- Could the text have inverted the logic?

---

### Issue #3: GDP Dominance Claim

**Question**: Does Keay or Johnson cite Angus Maddison's data?

**Expected Answer**:
- This is a specific economic claim requiring data
- Keay's book may reference economic historians
- Johnson may discuss trade volumes but not necessarily GDP share

**Need to Check**:
- Does Keay's "India: A History" contain GDP data?
- Does it reference Maddison or other economic historians?
- Is the "largest GDP share" claim directly from these sources?

   - Are there contradictions?
   - What is the scholarly consensus?
