#FederationUsage
Chrystallum should treat each federation as part of a **stacked evidence ladder**: from broad identity hints at the top to hard, low-level evidence at the bottom. The system’s job is to move a candidate node as far down that ladder as possible before it’s considered “solid.”

Below, I’ll walk through how the system should leverage each federation layer for your main node types, in narrative form.

***

## 1. People and Names (Person, Gens, Praenomen, Cognomen)

### Step 1: Broad identity via Wikidata and VIAF
When the system encounters a person string like “Gaius Julius Caesar,” it first:
- Resolves to a Wikidata QID (e.g., Q1048) to anchor the identity in a widely-used hub.
- Follows the external identifier to VIAF (the authority file federation for authors/creators).

**How to use it:**
- Use VIAF to confirm:
  - Canonical name forms in multiple languages.
  - Whether this is a real, curated authority or a marginal/uncertain record.
- If VIAF has multiple clusters, that’s a signal to the system: “Name collision—treat with caution.”

Result: you now have a **high-level identity assertion** for an elite person, suitable for “Prosopography of elites, author of texts, subject of modern works.”

### Step 2: Deepening identity via Trismegistos People and PIR

For historical *non-elites* or to check that elites appear in primary evidence, the system:
- Uses the Trismegistos person ID (TM_People) to see where and how often the name occurs in papyri/inscriptions.
- For Roman elites, uses PIR / PLRE (reached via Trismegistos links or your own mapping) as the **gold-standard curated prosopography**.

**How to use it:**
- If a candidate Person only exists in Wikidata, treat them as “textual-level, unconfirmed.”
- If they appear in Trismegistos people records and PIR:
  - Increase confidence that this is a historically grounded individual.
  - Pull in:
    - Offices held.
    - Attested locations.
    - Date ranges of activity.
- Use those as **constraints** in your graph:
  - “Do not allow events with this person outside their active date window or geography envelope.”

### Step 3: Onomastics and micro-evidence (LGPN, DDbDP, etc.)

For deeper name analysis:
- For Greek names: consult LGPN (Lexicon of Greek Personal Names).
- For documentary papyri: use DDbDP entries that actually show the person in a contract or receipt.

**How to use it:**
- When constructing a Claim like “Person X is a Greek freedman in Alexandria,” you can:
  - Use LGPN frequency and distribution to support the cultural/ethnic inference.
  - Use DDbDP documents as explicit **Evidence nodes** linking Person → Document → Place → Date.

Outcome: the **Person node** ceases to be just an identity label and becomes a historically constrained agent with time, place, and social context derived from multi-level federated evidence.

## 2. Places (Place)

### Step 1: Conceptual place via Pleiades

When the system encounters a place (e.g., “Emerita Augusta”):
- It resolves to a Pleiades place ID.
- Pleiades provides:
  - Conceptual place (not just a point).
  - Ancient and modern names.
  - Temporal associations (which periods the place is valid in).

**How to use it:**
- Use the Pleiades ID as your **canonical place key**.
- Store:
  - All name variants.
  - Temporal validity to constrain events: “Events using this place must occur inside its valid period unless explicitly flagged as anachronistic.”

### Step 2: Local and granular geography via Trismegistos Geo and DARE

For finer-grained location:
- Use Trismegistos Geo to get village-level or quarter-level IDs (especially in Egypt/Eastern Mediterranean).
- Use DARE for road networks, military installations, and Roman administrative geography.

**How to use it:**
- When building an Event (e.g., “Movement of Legio X”), use DARE to:
  - Validate plausible routes and distances between Pleiades places.
- When a papyrus or inscription has a local toponym:
  - Map that to TM_Geo, then to Pleiades, to anchor tiny local places in your global ancient map.

### Step 3: Modern ground truth via GeoNames/OSM

For mapping and visualization:
- Use GeoNames and OpenStreetMap as modern references for coordinates and country-level context.

**How to use it:**
- Provide modern coordinates and bounding boxes for visualization and spatial queries.
- Use modern admin boundaries only as **UI/context**, never as the primary historical ontology (Roman province, not “Spain”).

## 3. Events, Claims, Communications

### Step 1: Event candidates via Wikidata

Wikidata gives you:
- Named events (battles, reforms, assassinations).
- Simple triples: `Caesar –> participant in –> Battle of Pharsalus`.

**How to use it:**
- Treat these as **event seeds**, not fully trusted events.
- For each such triple, the system proposes an Event node:
  - Event type (Battle, Law, Foundation).
  - Participant roles (ordered_by, commanded_by, affected_party).

### Step 2: Evidence alignment via Trismegistos Texts and EDH

To turn event seeds into **historical events**, the system:
- Searches Trismegistos texts for documents referring to the event, participants, or place.
- Searches EDH for inscriptions commemorating or mentioning the same event or actors.

**How to use it:**
- Create **Communication nodes** for each text/inscription:
  - Author/speaker (Livy, inscription sponsor).
  - Audience (Senate, public).
  - Medium (scroll, stone).
- Link Event → Communication as evidence, with role annotations like:
  - “Primary inscriptional evidence.”
  - “Later literary narrative.”
- Raise the Event’s confidence when at least one epigraphic or documentary source is attached.

### Step 3: Claim modeling and provenance

Using HiCO-like structures:
- Model each historical statement as a Claim:
  - Claimant (Livy).
  - Claim content (date, outcome, motive).
  - Target Event.

**How to use it:**
- Store multiple Claims per Event:
  - Livy’s date vs. Polybius’ date vs. modern scholarly reconstruction.
- Use federation sources to classify:
  - Primary evidence (EDH, papyrus).
  - Secondary narrative (Livy, Plutarch).
- Enable your “frameworks” to weight claims differently:
  - A “source-critical” framework might privilege epigraphy over narrative.

Outcome: Events become **nodes anchored by multi-source claims**, not flat facts.

## 4. Time (Year, Period)

### Step 1: Period semantics via PeriodO

When the system sees “Late Republic” or “Augustan Age”:
- It resolves these terms to PeriodO IDs with explicit start/end years.

**How to use it:**
- Attach Period nodes to Events and Persons as “temporal envelopes.”
- Use them to:
  - Check plausibility (no event outside its labeled period).
  - Enable lensing: “Show me just events in ‘Late Republic’ per PeriodO.”

### Step 2: Year as a first-class node

For precise dates:
- Use ISO-like normalized years and dates, but connect them to:
  - PeriodO periods.
  - Calendar systems (Julian vs. proleptic Gregorian, etc.).

**How to use it:**
- Every Event gets:
  - A Year node (or date range).
  - One or more Period nodes.
- Temporal reasoning:
  - Overlaps, precedence, simultaneity can be calculated using these standardized intervals.

## 5. Concepts, Institutions, LegalRestriction, Organization, Subject

### Step 1: Concept and institution semantics via Getty AAT + LCSH/FAST

For abstract categories (e.g., “colony,” “senate,” “tax,” “imperium”):
- Use Getty AAT as the deep hierarchy of concepts.
- Use LCSH/FAST as the subject-topic hierarchy used in library science.

**How to use it:**
- For each Concept, Institution, or LegalRestriction:
  - Assign an AAT concept (e.g., “colony (settlements)”).
  - Assign LCSH/FAST subject headings for crosswalk into bibliographic systems.
- Enable:
  - Faceted navigation (“show me all events involving colonial institutions”).
  - Topic-based discovery (“works about Roman taxation crises”).

### Step 2: Law and restriction specifics

For LegalRestriction:
- Use whatever structured Roman law resources you can (e.g., curated corpora of Twelve Tables, Digest, etc.).
- Often these won’t have clean public APIs; you may need to treat this as a **local federation you build**.

**How to use it:**
- Each Law or Restriction node:
  - Links to its text in a digital law corpus.
  - Gets typed via AAT (law, legal decision, right, duty).
- Use this to:
  - Link Events (e.g., reforms, trials) to concrete legal changes.
  - Allow queries like “show me all events that weaken senatorial legal prerogatives.”

## 6. How the System Should Operationalize This

### Ingestion phase
1. Start from Wikidata (QID) as the **router**.
2. Follow external IDs to:
   - Pleiades (Places)
   - VIAF/Trismegistos (Persons)
   - PeriodO (Periods)
   - Others as appropriate.
3. For each federation hit:
   - Normalize and store the canonical ID.
   - Pull selected key fields (names, dates, roles, coordinates) into your node, but keep external IDs for deeper drill-down.

### Validation phase
1. Apply your schema constraints:
   - “A Person must have at least one temporal envelope supported by some external authority.”
   - “An Event with a Pleiades place and EDH inscription is higher confidence than one with Wikipedia only.”
2. Use depth:
   - Count how many “levels” down the federation tree you’ve reached (e.g., VIAF + Trismegistos + PIR + DDbDP).
   - Translate that into a confidence score.

### Analysis and lensing phase
1. For any claim or event:
   - The UI can show a **federation badge**:
     - “Backed by: Pleiades, EDH, Trismegistos.”
2. Frameworks (Marxist, Great Man, etc.) can:
   - Prefer events with deeper evidence chains.
   - Downweight events only supported by shallow, single-source data.

In short, each federation is not just a data source; it is a **different kind of epistemic support**. Your system should:
- Use the hub (Wikidata) to route.
- Use domain authorities (Pleiades, VIAF, Trismegistos, EDH, PeriodO, Getty AAT) to **shape** entities.
- Use specialist archives to **anchor** them with hard evidence.

That is how Chrystallum turns “a web of APIs” into a coherent, graded ladder of historical certainty.
