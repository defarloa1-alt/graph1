# AI Context and Handover Log
Maintained by LLM agents to preserve context across sessions.

## ⚠️ Important: Persistence Workflow

**This file only works as a memory bank if committed and pushed regularly.**

- **Local sessions**: Updates are visible in real-time ✅
- **Future sessions**: Only see last pushed version ⚠️
- **Other AI agents**: Need to pull latest from GitHub ⚠️

**Workflow for AI agents:**
1. **Start of session**: Read this file first (pull latest if stale)
2. **During session**: Update as you complete milestones
3. **End of session**: Commit and push this file so next agent sees current state

**Without regular pushes, this becomes a local-only scratchpad.**

## Project
Chrystallum Knowledge Graph
Goal: Build a federated historical knowledge graph using Neo4j, Python, and LangGraph.

## Current Architecture State (verified 2026-02-13)

### 1. Temporal Backbone (Calendrical Spine)
Structure:
`Year -> PART_OF -> Decade -> PART_OF -> Century -> PART_OF -> Millennium`

Status: Implemented.

Decisions locked in:
- Historical mode: no `Year {year: 0}` node.
- Year sequence is unidirectional: `FOLLOWED_BY` only.
- BCE/CE labels are historical-style while IDs remain numeric buckets.

Canonical implementation files:
- `scripts/backbone/temporal/genYearsToNeo.py`
- `scripts/backbone/temporal/migrate_temporal_hierarchy_levels.py`
- `scripts/backbone/temporal/05_temporal_hierarchy_levels.cypher`

### 2. Historical Period Spine
Status in clean baseline: not materialized in the live DB.

Notes:
- `scripts/backbone/temporal/create_canonical_spine.py` exists for period/era modeling.
- `scripts/backbone/temporal/link_years_to_periods.py` does not exist.

### 3. Live Neo4j Baseline (clean)
Only temporal backbone labels are present:
- `Year: 4025` (`-2000..2025`, no year 0)
- `Decade: 403`
- `Century: 41`
- `Millennium: 5`

Relationships:
- `FOLLOWED_BY` (Year chain): 4024
- `PART_OF`: 4469
- `PRECEDED_BY`: 0
- Bridge exists: `(-1)-[:FOLLOWED_BY]->(1)`

## Key Corrections (important)
- Previous notes claiming `link_years_to_periods.py` were inaccurate.
- Migration scripts were synced to corrected historical logic (BCE-safe bucketing and labels).
- Documentation was updated to reflect `FOLLOWED_BY`-only year sequencing.

## Recommended Next Steps
- If rebuilding backbone from scratch:
  1. Run `python scripts/backbone/temporal/genYearsToNeo.py --start -2000 --end 2025`
  2. Run `python scripts/backbone/temporal/migrate_temporal_hierarchy_levels.py --apply`
- Verify with:
  - `python Python/check_year_range.py`
  - graph checks for orphan years (`Year` without `PART_OF -> Decade`).
