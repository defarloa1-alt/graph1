2-17-26 Architecture Review 4 (Remediated)

Status: aligned to v0 bootstrap contract with explicit v1+ deferrals.

Purpose
- Capture how backlink density can be used without violating v0 scope.
- Define what is allowed now (v0) vs later (v1+).
- Resolve role and promotion ambiguities from the draft discussion.

Decisions Applied
1) Promotion gates are mandatory:
- Confirmed: density never bypasses v0 promotion gates.
- Promotion still requires NOT filters, meta-ceiling checks, and explicit logged promotion.

2) Metric source is bounded and reproducible:
- Confirmed: backlink metrics are computed from mapped/capped scaffold outputs in the AnalysisRun.
- Unrestricted global Wikidata backlink counts are not authoritative for v0 automation.

3) Ownership model (temporary v0 rule):
- Confirmed for now: once a subject is active, the subject SCA acts as concierge for that subject.
- Future architecture may re-introduce a separate long-lived concierge layer.

4) Subagents in v0:
- Confirmed: no autonomous subagent spawning in v0.
- SFAs may only emit proposal signals (for SCA/concierge approval workflows).

5) Threshold policy:
- Selected direction: v1 uses categorized and normalized density, with cooldown/hysteresis controls.
- Numeric calibration remains pending by domain after telemetry.

6) Text normalization:
- Encoding and formatting normalized to plain ASCII for reliable diffs/tooling.

v0 Allowed Uses of Backlink Density
- Ranking signal for review queues.
- Ranking signal for SFA training target priority.
- Advisory signal for "needs_subagent" proposals only (non-executing in v0).
- Advisory signal for potential cross-domain bridge review queues.

v0 Non-Allowed Uses
- Direct canonization trigger without full promotion governance.
- Autonomous agent creation/splitting based only on density.
- Reliance on uncapped/unmapped external counts for automated decisions.

Operational Metric Definitions (v0)
- backlink_count_domain(sc):
  Count of scaffold-linked entities/events/works tied to SubjectConcept `sc`
  within one AnalysisRun, using only mapped properties and enforced caps.

- claim_count(sc):
  Count of claims attached to `sc` (candidate or canonical views as configured),
  used as an auxiliary workload signal.

- centrality_score(sc):
  Weighted ranking score used for queue ordering only in v0.
  Example dimensions: `backlink_count_domain`, authority alignment, completeness.

Implementation Notes
- Keep this review doc as a policy interpretation layer, not the canonical contract.
- Normative v0 implementation requirements remain in:
  `md/Architecture/2-17-26-CHRYSTALLUM_v0_AGENT_BOOTSTRAP_SPEC.md`

Follow-up for v1 Discussion
- Calibrate percentile and absolute floor defaults per facet category.
- Define anti-churn controls and max subagent fanout per domain.
- Implement federation matrix execution from:
  `Facets/facet_federation_matrix.json`
  and
  `md/Architecture/2-17-26-Facet-Federation-Action-Plan.md`
