# md/Guides Consolidation

## Scope
- Reviewed guide files for overlap, external references, and path freshness.
- Applied strict consolidation to keep a lean active guide set.

## Active Keep Set
- `md/Guides/CLEAR_NEO4J_DATA_GUIDE.md`
- `md/Guides/Neo4j_Import_Guide.md`
- `md/Guides/Neo4j_Quick_Start.md`
- `md/Guides/SCRIPTS_AND_FILES_GUIDE.md`
- `md/Guides/Temporal_Comprehensive_Documentation.md`

## Archived
- `Archive/md/Guides/Config_README.md`
- `Archive/md/Guides/Graph_Visualization_Guide.md`
- `Archive/md/Guides/import_instructions.txt`
- `Archive/md/Guides/Neo4j_Startup_Guide.md`
- `Archive/md/Guides/Prompts_README.md`
- `Archive/md/Guides/Temporal_Comprehensive_Summary.md`
- `Archive/md/Guides/Temporal_CSV_Results_Summary.md`
- `Archive/md/Guides/Temporal_Quick_Reference.md`
- `Archive/md/Guides/Temporal_Quick_Start.md`
- `Archive/md/Guides/Temporal_README.md`

## Why Archived
- Unreferenced by other active docs.
- Redundant with kept guides (quick/summarized variants of same workflows).
- Outdated structure assumptions (legacy folder layouts and prompt subfolder assumptions).

## Notes
- `SCRIPTS_AND_FILES_GUIDE.md` is kept because it is still referenced by agent training docs, but it should be treated as a maintenance candidate for future cleanup/version refresh.
