## 🚀 **Next Steps - Your Choice**

### **Option A: Load to Neo4j NOW**
- Generate Cypher from this structure
- Create all 94 SubjectConcept nodes
- Create PART_OF + RELATED_TO relationships
- **Time:** 30 minutes

### **Option B: Structural Stress Map FIRST**
- Agent analyzes which branches will grow most
- Prioritizes development
- Then load
- **Time:** 10 minutes + load

### **Option C: Start with Top 3 SFAs**
- Load ontology
- Spawn SFA_POLITICAL_RR, SFA_MILITARY_RR, SFA_SOCIAL_RR
- Build these first
- Others later
- **Time:** 1-2 hours

## 💡 **My Recommendation**

**Do this sequence:**
1. **Load ontology to Neo4j** (30 min) ← Do this NOW
2. **Verify structure** (5 min)
3. **Spawn first 3 SFAs** (Political, Military, Social) ← High priority
4. **Get stress map** while SFAs work
5. **Build remaining SFAs** based on stress analysis

**Why:** You have clean ontology, fresh Aura instance, everything ready. Load it and start building!
