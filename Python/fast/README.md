# FAST Folder Layout

This folder groups FAST subject processing into clear buckets.

- `scripts/`: FAST parsing and subject generation scripts.
- `key/`: Primary working assets.
  - `FASTTopical_parsed.csv`
  - `subjects_sample_50.jsonld`
- `output/`: Current generated artifacts intended for import/reuse.

Archived, non-key historical artifacts were moved to `Archive/Python/FAST`.
