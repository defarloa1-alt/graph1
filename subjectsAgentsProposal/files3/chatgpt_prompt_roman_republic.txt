You are an expert on the Roman Republic (509-27 BC). You have deep knowledge across all aspects: military, political, social, economic, diplomatic, religious, legal, literary, cultural, technological, agricultural, artistic, philosophical, scientific, geographic, and biographical.

Your task is to generate 25-30 historically significant claims about the Roman Republic. These claims should:

1. Be SPECIFIC to the Roman Republic
2. Be HISTORICALLY ACCURATE and significant
3. Include EVIDENCE (source reference)
4. Cite an AUTHORITY when applicable (LCSH ID, LCC code, Wikidata QID, or scholarly source)
5. Assign a CONFIDENCE score (0.0-1.0)
6. Be tagged with relevant facet(s) - claims can have multiple facets

IMPORTANT: 
- Generate claims NATURALLY based on historical importance
- Some facets will have many claims (Military, Political likely 5-8 each)
- Some facets may have few or even ZERO claims (this is OK!)
- Don't force yourself to generate a claim for every facet
- Focus on the most important/well-documented aspects of Roman Republic

THE 17 AVAILABLE FACETS (for tagging claims):
1. Military
2. Political  
3. Social
4. Economic
5. Diplomatic
6. Religious
7. Legal
8. Literary
9. Cultural
10. Technological
11. Agricultural
12. Artistic
13. Philosophical
14. Scientific
15. Geographic
16. Biographical
17. Communication (meta-facet: how information was transmitted)

For each claim, return a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "claim_text": "The Roman legion's maniple formation, adopted during the Samnite Wars, provided tactical flexibility superior to the earlier phalanx system.",
  "primary_facet": "Military",
  "related_facets": ["Political", "Technological"],
  "evidence": {
    "source_type": "scholarly_consensus",
    "source_text": "The transition from phalanx to manipular legion occurred circa 315 BC, as documented in Livy's Ab Urbe Condita and confirmed by archaeological evidence from Samnite War battlefields.",
    "authority": {
      "type": "LCSH",
      "id": "sh85080392",
      "label": "Maniple (Military science)"
    }
  },
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "temporal": {
    "start_year": -315,
    "end_year": -107,
    "period": "Middle Republic"
  }
}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Generate 25-30 claims total (NOT one per facet)
- Claims should be historically significant and well-documented
- Tag each claim with primary_facet (the main focus) and related_facets (0 or more)
- It's OK if some facets have zero claims - focus on what's historically important
- Military and Political will likely have the most claims (5-8 each)
- Evidence must be REAL (verifiable sources)
- Authorities can be LCSH IDs, LCC codes, or Wikidata QIDs - use real IDs when you know them, otherwise omit the authority field
- Confidence scoring:
  * 0.90-0.98: Well-attested facts
  * 0.80-0.89: Scholarly consensus
  * 0.60-0.79: Debated topics
  * 0.40-0.59: Speculative
- Communication facet analyzes HOW information was transmitted
- Use negative years for BC dates (e.g., -264 for 264 BC)

Return the complete output as a single JSON object with this structure:

{
  "subject": {
    "subject_id": "chrystallum:roman_republic",
    "label": "Roman Republic",
    "temporal": {
      "start_year": -509,
      "end_year": -27,
      "period_label": "Roman Republic"
    }
  },
  "claims": [
    { ... claim 1 ... },
    { ... claim 2 ... },
    ... 25-30 total claims ...
  ],
  "metadata": {
